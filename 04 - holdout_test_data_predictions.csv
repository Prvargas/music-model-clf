Make another one known rapper seem deceased_x000D_
And keep him under, make him wonder 9 to 5_x000D_
And if he don't survive_x000D_
That's just another brother that's been buried alive_x000D_
Cuz time is money and money is time_x000D_
And I got just enough time to say these rhymes _x000D_

Phora,As Time Goes By,"As Time Goes By LyricsI love you like you'll never know_x000D_
I know we had our differences, but girl it's time to let it go_x000D_
Cause right now is when I need you the most_x000D_
Things ain't always what they seem until you see em' up close_x000D_
So can you see it?_x000D_
If I said you were the one, would you believe it?_x000D_
If I told you love is pain, would that be something you'd agree with?_x000D_
Just leave it and see where life takes us_x000D_
I know you've heard a lot of shit_x000D_
But I promised it, no one's gonna break us_x000D_
Lying on the ground, looking at the stars above_x000D_
Wondering if the angels are looking down on us_x000D_
It got me wondering if Lalo can see me_x000D_
Cause if he could, he'd probably be proud of me, life isn't easy_x000D_
I know it, especially when your loved one's coming and going_x000D_
I'm having trouble with my feelings, can't show no emotions_x000D_
Gave em' everything I had, you can call it devotion_x000D_
Did this for my people and my family, I hope that they notice_x000D_
Yeah, but as time keeps passing_x000D_
Everything changes, that's the way things happen_x000D_
I used to hate that I loved you so much_x000D_
Cause when I felt like giving up_x000D_
In my mind you were stuck_x000D_
Stuck in my mind, shit I just couldn't leave you behind_x000D_
Till I realized that all I really needed was time_x000D_
Cause time heals everything, even broken hearts_x000D_
Run my fingers through your hair, till you kiss me in the dark_x000D_
Form my hands around your waist, tell you everything's okay_x000D_
Listen, all I need is you girl, so tell me that you'll stay_x000D_
In touch with the soul, intact with the spirit_x000D_
I wrote this song for you, I just hope that you hear it_x000D_
But if not, at least I know I tried_x000D_
Throw my ashes in the ocean, feel my spirit in the sky_x000D_
Sometimes I sit alone, all alone and wonder why_x000D_
Why life is such a motherfucking bitch and then you die_x000D_
Well, shit I guess nothing's guaranteed in life_x000D_
I just hope you think of me before you sleep at night_x000D_
I'm depressed, the doctor just says I ain't eating right_x000D_
But I feel like it's something more than that_x000D_
Cause it hurts to know that Brian has cancer_x000D_
Cause that's what my grandpa died from_x000D_
So many questions with no answers_x000D_
Guess these are the things you just can't hide from_x000D_
But I don't wanna hide no more_x000D_
I don't wanna be shy when I look into your eyes no more_x000D_
I don't want nobody else cause baby I'm all yours_x000D_
And I'mma let it be known from CA to the 904_x000D_

Scarface,A Minute to Pray and a Second to Die,"A Minute to Pray and a Second to Die Lyrics_x000D_
Life goes on in the streets of my hood when you die_x000D_
But some cry, and gets by, while others choose to wonder why_x000D_
His life was took at such an early age_x000D_
A young nigga who lived in a rage died by the gauge_x000D_
He used to hustle on the street corners_x000D_
His mom would always beg him to quit, but he didn't wanna_x000D_
As he got older, he got even worse_x000D_
Til a real nigga showed him the purpose of a hearse_x000D_
A cold night in his hood, he had a tangle_x000D_
The brother he was squabblin with, had broke his ankle_x000D_
Laid him out in the driveway_x000D_
Some people knew he wouldn't survive, but hey_x000D_
I ain't the one to speak up on another's_x000D_
All I can do is try to open his eyes and help the brother_x000D_
He chose the wrong way and that's the route he took_x000D_
Born and brought up as an angel but he died as a crook_x000D_
He had a baby that he couldn't raise_x000D_
And she will never see her father again, 'cause he's in a grave_x000D_
Hey yo, let's think about it, nilla_x000D_
""My daddy was a dopeman, so I'ma be a dope dealer""_x000D_
How will the family explain it?_x000D_
""My daughter had a baby for a 'caine head!""_x000D_
He ain't around to see her walk_x000D_
Dry her eyes when she cries, pick her up when she falls_x000D_
Just the thought of a kid livin fly fucks me up_x000D_
When his girl has to raise a BASTARD child_x000D_
It gets deeper, he used to punch her and beat her_x000D_
She was loyal to his ass but accused as a cheater_x000D_
She had a good deck but she picked the wrong card_x000D_
Had a kid, now she's realizin life is hard_x000D_
A big time dope dealer's all she wanted_x000D_
Who drove a Jag or a Benz so she could flaunt it_x000D_
The situation's got me guessin_x000D_
But the answer remains to be a question_x000D_
He lived his life in a lie_x000D_
I guess you only get a minute to pray, and a second to die_x000D_
It was crazy how it happened_x000D_
Some niggas rolled by in the Riviera cappin_x000D_
All I could see was a pistol spittin rounds_x000D_
And the boy was just screamin as he fell to the ground_x000D_
A woman yelled ""get an ambulance""_x000D_
But I knew he was dead, he didn't stand a chance_x000D_
You shoulda seen him, he was scared_x000D_
A bullet goes to his chest, and one to his head_x000D_
He just laid there in silence_x000D_
And all I heard was the sirens_x000D_
Paramedics pulled up_x000D_
Followed by a lawman and then came a firetruck_x000D_
Put his ass on the stretcher_x000D_
But if he survives, I'm willin to betcha_x000D_
He'll be out for revenge_x000D_
They patched him up within a week, he was back at it again_x000D_
Went to his brother on the Northside_x000D_
Grab your shit, it's a hit, we're gonna take a long ride_x000D_
Packed it up in the trunk_x000D_
AK-47, M-11 and a pump_x000D_
Rolled by Worthing on Scott Street_x000D_
School was lettin out_x000D_
""Yo you ain't gonna shoot yet?"" ""WATCH ME!""_x000D_
Opened his trunk and grabbed a shotgun_x000D_
He shot him_x000D_
Put his tooly on the front seat_x000D_
Continued his mission, as he headed down the street_x000D_
The kids was just starin at each other_x000D_
J.D. rolled by and smoked Blackâ€™s brother_x000D_
Reached in his coat and grabbed a 'port_x000D_
Full speed down Reed, shot his mom on the porch_x000D_
On his way down Cullen_x000D_
His brother was just dazed in a shock, ""Why you do it?""_x000D_
""Why you shoot his moms Jay? Shit""_x000D_
""Hehehehehe.. hah man fuck that bitch""_x000D_
Went to the store to use the payphone_x000D_
Called up Mack, ""Aiyyo J.D. homie""_x000D_
Hung it up and rolled down Dacca_x000D_
Headin for the nigga he was after_x000D_
By the time he arrived at the scene_x000D_
Malcolm was ready for anything_x000D_
He tried to sneak around the back way_x000D_
Never thought of bein taken out on that day_x000D_
Black boy, black coat_x000D_
Stood around the corner as he passed slit his throat_x000D_
He didn't fall so he fired_x000D_
One to the middle of his skull, he's expired_x000D_
A whole army came out_x000D_
Twenty-seven niggas all strapped out of one house_x000D_
That how it happens in the Acre_x000D_

'Cause it would be such a relief to be objectified_x000D_

Looking forth and looking back, our vision can't extend beyond the quaint vanishing points our bodies' recommend_x000D_
And I'll help you move some furniture somewhere it's never been before, but the room's so small the dresser drawer won't let us get back out the door_x000D_

It's like this and only this, so I'm gwaan tell_x000D_
Me and my moms in front of the mall, and then I seen this nigga, Ramel_x000D_
From fifth grade_x000D_
I knew this kid was swift_x000D_
Paid was how his mind logged, so he got his grind on_x000D_
But now it's years later_x000D_

Lead fly, ratta-tat-tatted, his blood spattered_x000D_
I strive to see the driver with my eye_x000D_
Moms grabbed sky, and caught lead in her thigh, I_x000D_
Put her behind the trash can, dashed to my man_x000D_
It was too late, it's sad that Ramel was perforated_x000D_
Waited and sweated for the medics as my moms bled_x000D_
Even if he was alive at the scene, by now my man Ram's dead_x000D_
The cops do not care_x000D_
'Cause our skin has too much shade in it'_x000D_
They'll dismiss this as some niggas misbehavin'_x000D_
But I'll never forget the driver of that blue Seville_x000D_
And live for the day to bust shots in his grill_x000D_

I'm just curious, niggas can't be serious_x000D_
Woke up like, ""What year is it?"" Niggas on their period_x000D_
My change done gave me somethin', it ain't no curin' it_x000D_

They throwin' a couple hundreds just so you can deliver it_x000D_
You said if he robbed you that you was gon' kill him_x000D_
I seen him today, I'm just curious_x000D_
I told her don't put me on child support, I'ma give extra but she wasn't hearin' it_x000D_
I take you around the killer, the robbers, the shooters just for the experience_x000D_
Don't try to dodge you, make up yo bed, you lay in it, niggas ain't hearin' it_x000D_
I get yo bitch in the Bentley, she gon' see some shit she never experienced_x000D_
I am a Captain, I get you crunched and put in a box, no cereal_x000D_
This automatic hit that whip, nothing gon' help niggas short of a miracle_x000D_
Tryna to make a million off a Bloodas tour but his P.O. not clearin' him_x000D_
Tryna make a M and M but he couldn't do it and that shit was killin' him_x000D_
And I grew up in the ghetto, I ain't never hung around gentlemen_x000D_
Bought the drugs, take the drugs, niggas in the hood ain't really tryna get it_x000D_

This bitch tryna get me to invest in weave _x000D_
I told her, ""Yes,"" just to finesse that freak _x000D_

Arlo Guthrie,The Pause of Mr. Claus,"The Pause of Mr. Claus Lyrics_x000D_
This next song we're going to dedicate to a great American organization. Tonight I'd like to dedicate this to our boys in the FBI_x000D_
Well, wait a minute. It's hard to be an FBI man. I mean, first Of all, being an FBI man, you have to be over 40 years old. And the reason is that it takes at least 25 years with the organization to be that much of a bastard. It's true. You just Can't join, you know. It needs an atmosphere where your natural bastardness can grow and develop and take a meaningful shape in today's complex society_x000D_
But that's not why I want to dedicate the song to the FBI. I mean, the job that they have to do is a drag. I mean, they have To follow people around, you know. That's part of their job. Follow me around_x000D_
I'm out on the highway and I'm drivin down the road and I run out of gasoline. I pull over to the side of the road. They gotta pull over too - make believe that they ran out, you know_x000D_
I go to get some gasoline. They have to figure out whether they should stick with the car or follow me. Suppose I don't come back and they're stayin with the car_x000D_
Or if I fly on the airplanes, I could fly half fare because I'm 12 To 22. And they gotta pay the full fare. But the thing is that When you pay the full fare, you have to get on the airplane first, so that they know how many seats are left over for the half fare kids. Right? And sometimes there aren't any seats left over, and sometimes there are, but that doesn't mean that you have to go. Suppose that he gets on and fills up the last seat, so you can't get on. Then he gets off then you can get on. What's he gonna do?_x000D_
Well, it's a drag for him. But that's not why I want to dedicate the song to the FBI. During these hard days and hard weeks, everybody always has it bad once in a while. You know, you have a bad time of it, and you always have a friend who says ""Hey man, you ain't got it that bad. Look at that guy."" And you look at that guy, and he's got it worse than you. And it makes you feel better that there's somebody that's got it worse than you_x000D_
But think of the last guy. For one minute, think of the last guy. Nobody's got it worse than that guy. Nobody in the whole world. That guy ... he's so alone in the world that he isn't even have a street to lay in for a truck to run him over. He's out there with nothin. Nothin's happenin for that cat_x000D_
And all that he has to do to create a little excitement in his own life is to bum a dime from somewhere, call up the FBI. Say, ""FBI?"", they say ""Yes?"". Say, ""I dig Uncle Ho and Chairman Mao and their friends are comin over for dinner.""  Hang up the phone_x000D_
And within two minutes, and not two minutes from when he hangs up the phone, but two minutes from when he first put the dime in, they got 30,000 feet of tape rollin, files on tape, pictures, movies, dramas, actions on tape. But then they send out a half a million people all over the entire world, the globe, they find out all they can about this guy_x000D_
Cause there's a number of questions involved in the guy. I mean, if he was the last guy in the world, how'd he get a dime to call the FBI? There are plenty of people that aren't the last guys that can't get dimes. He comes along and he gets a dime. I mean, if he had to bum a dime to call the FBI, how was he gonna serve dinner for all of those people? How could the last guy MAKE dinner for all those people. And if he could make dinner, and was gonna make dinner, then why did he call the FBI?_x000D_
They find out all of those questions within two minutes. And that's a great thing about America. I mean, this is the only country in the world ... I mean, well, it's not the only country in the world that could find stuff out in two minutes, but it's the only country in the world that would take two minutes for that guy_x000D_
Other countries would say ""Hey, he's the last guy ... screw em"", you know? But in America, there IS no discrimination, and there IS no hypocrisy, cause they'll get ANYBODY. And that's a wonderful thing about America_x000D_
And that's why tonight I'd like to dedicate it to every FBI man in the audience. I know you can't say nothin, you know, you can't get up and say ""Hi!"" cause then everybody knows that you're an FBI man and that's a drag for you and your friends_x000D_
They're not really your friends, are they? I mean, so you can't get up and say nothin cause otherwise, you gotta get sent back to the factory and that's a drag for you and it's an expense for the government, and THAT'S a drag for you_x000D_
We're gonna sing you this Christmas carol. It's for all you bastards out there in the audience tonight. It's called ""The Pause of Mr. Claus""_x000D_

Mama locked the door last night_x000D_
For the first time in all of her years_x000D_

She said things ain't like they used to be 'round here_x000D_
You just wouldn't believe it_x000D_
Kids growin' up without Jesus_x000D_
A good thing your Daddy ain't here to see this now_x000D_
They stay higher than the water tower_x000D_
In this thirty-five mile an hour town_x000D_
She said it ain't the drugs, it ain't the booze_x000D_
I've had a back road buzz or two myself_x000D_
It seems like heaven's slippin' further away_x000D_
The devil ain't got far to go when they raise hell_x000D_
We used to burn a hole through midnight_x000D_
Smoking a stolen Marlboro Light and_x000D_
On a good night might kill a fifth of Crown_x000D_
But now there's a lower higher power_x000D_

Nine inches with ginseng, I'm not wasting time pretending_x000D_
I'm doing steak right now, I'm serving you onion rings_x000D_

No parking Wednesdays at noon and the garbage lines the streets_x000D_
A cereal box with cartoons and a price tag way too steep_x000D_
And a fence that leans to the south around a yard with specks of grass_x000D_
And a dog with more teeth than mouth chained up sifting through trash_x000D_
That ice cream truck rolls too slow and the picture's black and white_x000D_
And the cabin up back still ain't cold and it's mostly out at night_x000D_
And there ain't no kids where it go and it don't play music right_x000D_
And a kid with a hoodie looks old under the traffic light_x000D_
That liquor store sells Patron but it just sits on the shelf_x000D_
And that Steel Reserve in the back practically sells itself_x000D_
And the Arab up at the front don't ever touch the stuff_x000D_
Single Swishers and blunts in a package opened up_x000D_
And a white tee XXXL make the men on the corners look tough_x000D_
And the men on the corners have lines and the women walk by straight_x000D_
Bold black and red for sale signs posted up on the gates_x000D_
Of every other Victorian with wood over the windows_x000D_
And someone converses about Jordans while wearing last year's Timbos_x000D_
And a Chinese takeout menu decorates the gates with symbols_x000D_
And the cats are feral and fat and unreasonably nimble_x000D_
The trash is full to the top no cans or bottles in it_x000D_
Big bags being dragged down the street clanging and leaking liquid_x000D_
Expired tags on a Buick with one rim all in chrome_x000D_
And an older woman in stretch pants shuffles along too slow_x000D_
Pieces of flowers and a poem falling off a flickering light pole_x000D_
And a picture of someone it seems somebody used to know_x000D_
And a buzz in the air from a congregation of telephone wires_x000D_
And on the wires are birds sitting tiny and black_x000D_
And tennis shoes from the 90's looking fine and intact_x000D_
And a cable awkwardly hanging never reaching a house_x000D_
And below it a stained up and soggy formerly leather couch_x000D_
And rainbow patterns of oil pooling in potholed cement_x000D_
And a screen door with no hinges hanging hopelessly bent_x000D_
And a Bentley dressing the cover of a car magazine_x000D_
And a Price Is Right crowd cheering on a television screen_x000D_
With a big bat jutting out and the color mostly green_x000D_
And a stove where one burner works and the oven should be cleaned_x000D_
And coupons clipped on the table waiting to be redeemed_x000D_
And a siren sings long and deep and the chopper's double meaned_x000D_
And the median is asleep so to wake and walk at strange thingsÂ Â Â Â 2Embed",clipping.,Rap/Hip-Hop,False,yes,2628,parking wednesday noon garbage line cereal box cartoon price tag way fence lean south around yard speck dog teeth mouth chained sifting ice cream truck roll slow picture black cabin back still ai cold mostly ai kid go play music kid hoodie look old traffic liquor store sell patron sits steel reserve back practically sell arab front ever touch single swishers blunts package opened white tee xxxl make men corner look men corner line woman walk bold black red sale sign posted every victorian wood someone converse jordan wearing last year chinese takeout menu decorates gate cat feral fat unreasonably trash full top can bottle big bag dragged street clanging leaking expired tag buick one rim older woman stretch pant shuffle along piece flower poem falling flickering light picture someone seems somebody used buzz air congregation telephone wire bird sitting tiny tennis shoe looking fine cable awkwardly hanging never reaching stained soggy formerly leather rainbow pattern oil pooling potholed screen door hinge hanging hopelessly bentley dressing cover car price right crowd cheering television big bat jutting color mostly stove one burner work oven coupon clipped table waiting siren sings long deep chopper double median asleep wake walk strange thingsâ,1264,4,0,0.26,0.01,0.19,0.14,0.16,0.24
